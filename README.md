# CODE SMELLS
Project for the course Software Factory at unibz.

This directory contains the client side.
In order to run it you can clone the repository from Spring Tool Suite (STS).
If you have any errors, Update the Project (Maven -> Update Project).

Be sure that you have an active internet connection, because the libraries must be downloaded by the pom.xml file.
